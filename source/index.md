# Introduction!!!!

Welcome to the Cloakfusion API documentation! You can use our API to access Cloakfusion API endpoints, which can help you create, update and delete properties. You can also retrieve information about the data usage of your properties.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

### Formatting

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
format=json | true | If set , the result will be returned as JSON.
format=api | false | If set , the result will be returned as HTML.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -X GET https://my.cloakfusion.com/api/v1/vhosts/ -H 'Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b'
```

> Make sure to replace `9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b` with the real token.

For clients to authenticate, the token key should be included in the Authorization HTTP header. The key should be prefixed by the string literal "Token", with whitespace separating the two strings.
You can register a new Cloakfusion API key at our [portal](https://my.cloakfusion.com).
